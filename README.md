## 中文用户界面优化版

本 Fork 保留 Opaline 原有的播放、账号与数据能力，并参考 Bilibili 移动端的信息密度和浏览习惯，对视频浏览界面进行了本地化调整，让中文用户可以更高效地浏览内容：

- 首页、订阅、频道、搜索、历史记录和播放列表中的普通视频统一采用紧凑的双列布局
- 视频卡片移除投稿者头像，信息顺序调整为“标题 → 播放量/发布时间 → 投稿者名称”
- 缩小卡片与上下视频之间的留白，在手机屏幕上同时展示更多内容
- 首页默认直接显示全部推荐，不再占用空间展示分类标签
- 首页、订阅和媒体库统一使用宽搜索框，并在右侧保留提醒、设置和用户头像入口
- 媒体库的历史、下载和播放列表使用独立的分段菜单，层级更清晰
- Shorts 保持关闭，不参与双列视频流

这些调整只改变界面布局和浏览体验，尽量与上游代码保持较小差异，便于后续继续同步 Opaline 更新。本项目与 Bilibili 无隶属或关联关系，仅参考其常见的信息布局方式。

## Why

When Google dropped support for the official YouTube app on older devices, there was no way to watch videos properly. Browsers capped quality at 360p — and even that barely ran. Opaline was born to restore what was lost: high-quality playback on hardware that still works fine, just ignored by Google — a focused, lightweight client that does one thing well.

## Features

- **Video playback** — up to 1080p 60fps on every device; 2K/4K on hardware with AV1 decode (iPhone 15 Pro and newer, M3+ iPads)
- **Shorts** — a native full-screen viewer with vertical swiping, likes, comments and sharing; the next short is preloaded so it opens on video rather than a poster. Tapping a short anywhere carries that list into the viewer, and the whole tab can be switched off
- **Kids content** — plays videos the standard API sources refuse, via a dedicated playback source
- **Pinch to zoom** — fill the screen in fullscreen with a pinch, or turn on Zoom to Fill to do it automatically
- **Background audio** — continue listening with the screen off
- **Media controls** — play/pause and next/previous video from Control Center, the lock screen and headphones
- **Picture-in-Picture** — watch while using other apps
- **SponsorBlock** — skip sponsored segments automatically
- **Return YouTube Dislike** — see dislike counts again
- **Audio tracks** — switch dubbed audio on multi-language videos, or start videos dubbed in your language automatically; AI auto-dubs are marked "(AI)"
- **Subtitles** — full subtitle/caption support with VTT parsing
- **13 languages** — localized interface, with video titles/search/feeds following your language (see [Localization](#localization))
- **Search & browse** — live suggestions, recent-search history, filters (sort, upload date, type, duration), channel pages, playlists
- **Smart home feed** — endless recommendations shown directly in a compact two-column feed
- **Subscriptions** — follow channels with a local subscription feed
- **Notifications** — a bell in the top bar collects app news and new-version announcements, with the full release notes in the message; system notifications are optional and everything still collects in-app if you decline
- **Watch history** — progress indicators, synced across devices; a video resumes where you left it the moment you reopen it, without waiting for the server to catch up
- **Autoplay** — automatically play the next related video, with replay, previous and next offered when one ends
- **Auto theme** — follows system dark mode on iOS 13+, scheduled hours on iOS 12; manual override available
- **Made for old hardware** — thumbnails and channel details are fetched and decoded a few at a time rather than all at once, which is what keeps scrolling smooth on a dual-core A7
- **Your layout** — pick the tab the app opens on, force the icon light or dark, and browse settings as a nested menu instead of one long list

## Installation

Opaline runs on devices with **iOS 12 and above**.

### Non-jailbroken devices

**Option 1 — Add source (recommended)**

Add the Opaline source to your sideloading app to receive automatic updates:

<a href="https://stikstore.app/altdirect/?url=https://verback2308.github.io/repo/apps.json"><img src="https://github.com/StikStore/altdirect/raw/main/assets/png/AltSource_Blue.png" height="55" alt="Add Source"></a>

**Option 2 — Manual install**

[Download the latest IPA](https://github.com/verback2308/Opaline/releases/latest) and install via **SideStore**, **AltStore**, or **LiveContainer**.

**Option 3 — Build from source**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/verback2308/Opaline.git
cd Opaline
cp Config/Local.xcconfig.example Config/Local.xcconfig
./make_ipa.sh
```

### Jailbroken devices

**Option 1 — Cydia/Sileo repo (recommended)**

Add the repo to your package manager to install Opaline and receive automatic updates:

```
https://verback2308.github.io/repo/
```

Rootful (`iphoneos-arm`) and rootless (`iphoneos-arm64`) packages are provided; Sileo, Zebra and Cydia are supported. Every released version stays available in the repo, so you can also install or roll back to an older one (Sileo/Zebra: package page → version list).

Pick one channel and stay on it — the repo package and the IPA share a bundle identifier, and having both installed leaves an app icon the Home Screen cannot delete. Already have the other one? Remove it first: the IPA from the Home Screen, the repo package from your package manager (or `dpkg -r com.verback.ytlite` over SSH).

**Option 2 — Manual install**

Install the `.ipa` package directly:
- **Filza** — open the `.ipa` file → Install
- **ReProvision** — sign and install the IPA from the app

## Known Issues and Limitations

- Playback speeds above 2x may cause issues
- Comments are read-only — you can browse and sort them and open replies, but not post, reply or like
- Offline download is not yet available
- Notification delivery is scheduled by iOS, which grants background time at its own discretion — expect news to arrive within hours of publication, not minutes, and not at all while Background App Refresh or Low Power Mode says otherwise
- **Picture in Picture is limited by the system before iOS 15**, and no app can work around it: the window survives exactly one video, and switching to another one closes it and leaves audio playing — [the full findings are in issue #31](https://github.com/verback2308/Opaline/issues/31#issuecomment-5148224679)
  - Before iOS 14.2 the system only starts PiP by itself from **fullscreen**. Leaving the app while the video plays inline gives background audio instead — the PiP button works in both cases
  - Before iOS 15 background audio requires the player to give up its video layer, and the system then refuses to open PiP for that video at all. So once a video has played in the background, automatic PiP no longer starts for it — the PiP button still does, and the next video starts clean
  - On a **jailbroken device** PiP may not start at all — confirmed on an iPad mini 2 running iOS 12.5.8 with Chimera, and likely the same on checkra1n. The jailbreak denies it, not the app; installing [ForceInPicture](https://github.com/PoomSmart/ForceInPicture) restores it

## Localization

The interface follows your system language by default and can be overridden in **Settings → Language**. The content language (video titles, search, feeds — translated server-side by YouTube, like the official app) follows the app language; the region can be set separately.

> [!NOTE]
> Wording follows the official YouTube app's own translations wherever it has an equivalent string, but mistakes are still possible. If you spot a wrong or awkward translation — or want a language that isn't here — please [open an issue](../../issues) describing where it appears and what the correct wording should be.

## Playback Helper Server

The Mobile Web playback source (used for videos the primary source can't open, e.g. kids content) relies on a small companion service. Preparing these streams requires evaluating JavaScript from YouTube's public player page — something iOS 12-era devices can't do on-device. The app delegates that single step to the helper server and receives the computed result back.

**What it sees:** no account data, no tokens, no cookies, no watch history — only the challenge strings taken from the public player code and the ID of the video being prepared. If you're inspecting traffic and wondering about requests to a non-YouTube host — that's this.

The server's source code will be published later so you can host your own instance and point the app at it (**Settings → Debug → Solver Server**).

## Bug Reports

If you encounter a bug, you can export debug logs directly from the app:

**Settings → Debug → Share Debug Log**

This generates a log file you can attach to your GitHub issue. The log includes timestamped playback, API, and caching events that help diagnose problems.

## Building

```bash
git clone https://github.com/verback2308/Opaline.git
cd Opaline
cp Config/Local.xcconfig.example Config/Local.xcconfig
open Opaline.xcodeproj
```

Edit `Config/Local.xcconfig` and set your own `PRODUCT_BUNDLE_IDENTIFIER`.
`APP_MANIFEST_URL` in the same file points the update check at a release
manifest — leave the default to follow this repository, or aim it at a file
served from your own machine to test notifications. Release builds get the
URL of whatever repository they are built from, written in by the workflow.

Select the **Opaline** scheme, choose your device or simulator, and build (⌘B).

### Key Design Decisions

- **Zero external dependencies** — Networking via a custom `HTTPTransport` abstraction over `URLSession`, images via custom `ThumbnailImageView`, playback via `AVPlayer`
- **All UIKit, no SwiftUI** — Programmatic layout, no storyboards
- **iOS 12+ support** — No SF Symbols, no SwiftUI, no Combine
- **Manual JSON parsing** — `JSONSerialization` + dictionary traversal for YouTube Innertube API responses
- **Dependency injection** — `ServiceContainer` provides services; view controllers receive dependencies via initializers

### Playback Pipeline

Playback is built on a single `VideoSource` abstraction — each way of playing a video implements the same interface and owns both stream resolution and quality selection. `PlaybackFacade` just asks a factory for the configured source, calls `loadPlayback`, and hands the prepared `AVPlayerItem` to the player shell. The sources:

1. **Auto** *(default)* — Composite: tries Android VR first, transparently falls back to Mobile Web when a video fails to resolve or start.
2. **Android VR** — Streams via YouTube's Innertube API; adaptive formats (360p–1080p AVC, up to 4K AV1 on supported hardware) are converted from DASH SIDX byte ranges into an HLS playlist for native `AVPlayer`, with progressive/native-HLS fallbacks.
3. **Mobile Web** — Handles videos the Android VR client refuses (e.g. kids content). Stream URLs require solving JavaScript challenges from the player page; that step is delegated to the helper server (see above), everything else stays on-device.
4. **Progressive** — Direct 360p MP4 URL for the restricted case (e.g. server-side A/B experiments).

Quality selection is source-agnostic: the player UI simply renders whatever qualities the active source reports. Background audio is `AVAudioSession`-based and works across all sources.

### Authentication

OAuth device-code flow: the app requests a device code → user enters it at google.com/device → tokens are stored in Keychain. Anonymous browsing is supported.

## Project Structure

| Component | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|
| `InnertubeClient` | YouTube API: browse, search, player, comments, subscriptions |
| `PlaybackFacade` | Selects a `VideoSource` via factory, loads it, and drives player setup |
| `VideoPlayerView` | Custom player UI with controls, gestures, PiP |
| `WatchViewController` | Watch page: player + metadata + comments + related |
| `AppCache` | Dual-layer cache (memory + disk) with TTL |
| `SponsorBlockController` | SponsorBlock API integration |
| `ThemeManager` | App-wide theming (dark/light) |
